          <img class= "skateboard" src="skateboard.jpg">
          <p class="p1">I skateboard! I've been skateboarding ever since I was like 8. I fell in love with skateboarding when I first played the game called "SKATE" made by Rob Dyrdek - who is a famous skateboarder. I thought the things that they did on screen was amazing and I wanted to do them myself, So I forced my grandma to by me a skateboard and ever since then I've been skateboarding. </p>
          <h1> I draw!</h1>
          <img class= "drawing" src="rocklee.JPG">
        <p class="p1"> I drew this almost two years ago. I started off with drawing when I was really little. Of course I started off with box people but I grew and developed this ability to draw what ever I see. Like I'll see a drawing online and draw the exact same drawing in the exact same way!</p>
